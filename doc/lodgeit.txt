INTRODUCTION                                                          *lodgeit*

This plugin offers a |Lodgeit| command that allows you to retrieve a specific
paste or post a paste to a Lodgeit paste board.

The default paste board is located at http://paste.pocoo.org, this is a public
paste board.

The plugin can be configured to point at a custom installation of Lodgeit. The
custom install can be open to the public or protected by basic auth. See the
|lodgeit-settings| section for more info.

INSTALLATION                                             *lodgeit-installation*

If you are installing this plugin to use with a public facing Lodgeit instance
all you need to do is place the lodgeit.vim file into a plugin folder within
your |'runtimepath'|. The default location is ~/.vim/plugin.

If your installation is behind basic auth, then you will be prompted for your
username and password each time you access the Lodgeit instance. If you prefer
to save the password you can use the included keyring library.

Place the keyring folder in the same folder as the lodgeit.vim script. The
keyring package requires some files to be compiled. You can do this by running
the following: >

    $ cd ~/.vim/plugin/keyring
    $ python2.6 setup.py build_ext --inplace

The package requires Python 2.5+, so make sure to use the proper version of
Python when building the extensions.

USAGE                                                           *lodgeit-usage*

The lodgeit.vim plugin comes with one command.

:Lodgeit                                                              *Lodgeit*

    This command allows you to paste or retrieve pastes from the Lodgeit
    instance.

                                                                *lodgeit-paste*

    When calling the command with no options, you will send a paste to the
    paste board. If you have text selected using |visual-mode|, this is what
    will be pasted. Otherwise, the contents of the current buffer will be
    sent. >

        :Lodgeit

<
    After the paste has successfully been sent to the server, the URL will be
    placed into the + register. This means that the url will be in your system
    clipboard available for you to paste anywhere you like.

                                                             *lodgeit-retrieve*

    The Lodgeit command can also be used to retrieve a specific paste. If you
    call :Lodgeit with a #paste_num, that paste will be opened up in a new
    tab. >

        :Lodgeit #1

<
    Once you have opened a paste in this manner, you can reply to it simply by
    using the :Lodgeit command again.

SETTINGS                                                     *lodgeit-settings*

g:lodgeit_url                                                     *lodgeit_url*

    Set the URL to a custom lodgeit instance.

g:lodgeit_secure                                               *lodgeit_secure*

    If set to 1, you will be prompted for a password. The default is 0.

g:lodgeit_username                                           *lodgeit_username*

    The username to be used if lodgeit is secured with basic auth.
   
    This is optional when using the |lodgeit_secure| option. If you are using
    the provided Python keyring support then this will allow you to paste and
    retrieve items without entering a username or password each time.
